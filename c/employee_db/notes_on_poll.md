# How Poll Wors
Yes, you're on the right track. The poll() system call is used for monitoring multiple file descriptors (FDs) to see if they are ready for I/O operations, such as reading or writing. Here‚Äôs how it works:

    You create a pollfd array: Each entry in this array represents a file descriptor and the events you want to monitor (e.g., POLLIN for readable, POLLOUT for writable).

    Call poll() with the array and a timeout: The OS will block until:

        At least one FD becomes ready for the requested operation.

        The timeout expires.

        A signal interrupts the call.

    Check the revents field: After poll() returns, you iterate over the pollfd array and check the revents field to see which FDs have events.

    Handle the events: If an FD has POLLIN, you perform a read() on it. If it has POLLOUT, you perform a write(). You can also handle disconnections and errors by checking for flags like POLLERR or POLLHUP.

‚úÖ Key points:

    poll() waits for any of the FDs to become ready, not necessarily all of them.

    It updates the revents field for each FD that triggered an event.

    You need to loop through the pollfd array after poll() returns to handle the FDs that are ready.




# Network Interface Card and Poll
```
1. Network Interface Card (NIC) and Interrupts

    The NIC receives incoming packets from the network.

    When a packet arrives, the NIC stores it in a buffer (also called a ring buffer or RX queue).

    The NIC then triggers a hardware interrupt to notify the OS kernel that new data is available.

‚öôÔ∏è 2. Kernel Processing

Once the OS kernel receives the interrupt:

    It copies the packet from the NIC buffer into a kernel-space buffer.

    The kernel parses the packet to determine the protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.) and the destination socket.

    It updates the socket‚Äôs receive queue with the new data, making it available for user-space programs.

    The kernel then wakes up any process waiting on that socket by marking the socket as ready for reading (e.g., setting the POLLIN flag).

üõ†Ô∏è 3. poll() in User-Space

    Your C program calls poll() and goes into a sleeping state.

    While sleeping, your program is put on a wait queue by the kernel.

    When a packet arrives (or any other event happens), the kernel:

        Updates the revents field of the corresponding FD with POLLIN, POLLOUT, etc.

        Wakes up your process so it can continue execution.

    Your program then inspects the revents field and handles the I/O accordingly.

üöÄ Optimization: Avoiding Interrupt Storm

To prevent excessive interrupts (which slow down the system), the OS uses techniques like:

    NAPI (New API): Instead of generating an interrupt for every packet, the OS switches to polling mode when there‚Äôs a heavy packet load. It batches packet processing and reduces the number of interrupts.

    EPOLL and Event Queues: On Linux, epoll() is a more efficient alternative to poll() for handling large numbers of FDs, using a callback-based notification system.

üî• Key Takeaway

When you call poll():

    Your program sleeps until the OS kernel detects activity on one of the monitored FDs.

    The kernel gets this info through NIC interrupts, processes the packet, and marks the socket as ready.

    The kernel wakes up your program and you handle the event.
```

# NAPI
```
üöÄ NAPI (New API) ‚Äì Linux‚Äôs Efficient Network Processing

When you‚Äôre dealing with high packet rates, interrupt-driven processing becomes inefficient because:

    Each packet triggers an interrupt, leading to excessive context switching.

    The CPU spends more time handling interrupts than processing packets.

To solve this, Linux introduced NAPI (New API), which combines interrupts and polling to efficiently handle network traffic.
‚öôÔ∏è How NAPI Works

    Interrupt Mode (Low Traffic)

        When the NIC receives a packet, it triggers a hardware interrupt.

        The kernel processes the packet and places it in the socket buffer.

        For low packet rates, this method works fine.

    Switching to Polling Mode (High Traffic)

        When the packet rate increases beyond a certain threshold, NAPI switches to polling mode.

        Instead of generating interrupts for each packet, the NIC disables further interrupts.

        The kernel starts periodically polling the NIC for packets in a loop.

        This reduces the interrupt overhead by processing packets in batches.

    Back to Interrupt Mode

        Once the load decreases, NAPI switches back to interrupt mode.

üî• Why NAPI is Efficient

    Batch processing: It handles multiple packets per polling cycle instead of one packet per interrupt.

    Reduces interrupt storms: With fewer context switches, the system spends more time processing data rather than handling interrupts.

    Improved throughput: Especially beneficial for high-speed networks (e.g., 10GbE or 40GbE).

‚öôÔ∏è EPOLL ‚Äì Efficient Polling for Large FDs

While poll() is fine for a small number of FDs, it becomes inefficient when dealing with thousands of connections. This is where epoll() comes in.
üöÄ How epoll() Works

    Event-based Model

        Unlike poll(), which scans all FDs on every call, epoll() uses an event-driven model.

        You register FDs once with epoll_ctl().

        The kernel monitors the FDs and notifies your program only when an event occurs (e.g., readable, writable).

    Efficient FD Handling

        epoll uses edge-triggered or level-triggered modes:

            Edge-triggered (ET): You‚Äôre notified only when the state changes (more efficient for high-performance servers).

            Level-triggered (LT): You‚Äôre notified as long as the FD is ready (similar to poll() behavior).

        It avoids repeated scanning of all FDs, making it significantly faster for many connections.

üõ†Ô∏è epoll() vs. poll()
Feature	poll()	epoll()
Model	Linear scanning	Event-driven
Efficiency	O(n) complexity	O(1) complexity
FD limit	Limited by RLIMIT_NOFILE	Handles large FDs efficiently
Use case	Few FDs (e.g., <1000)	Many FDs (e.g., >1000)
Memory use	Requires re-building FD array	Kernel tracks FDs internally
üî• When to Use What

    poll() ‚Üí Simpler and fine for low-FD applications.

    epoll() ‚Üí Better for high-performance servers or applications managing thousands of connections.

    NAPI ‚Üí Automatically handled by the Linux kernel for efficient NIC packet handling, so you don‚Äôt have to configure it manually.

# Events and Revents in poll
In the code you've written, events and revents are fields within the struct pollfd structure, which is used in the poll() function to monitor multiple file descriptors (sockets, files, etc.) for specific events.

events:
This field is set by you, the programmer, to specify the types of events you're interested in for a given file descriptor. When you call poll(), the function will check the file descriptors for the specified events.

In your code, you use POLLIN as the event for the file descriptors:

c
Copy
Edit
fds[i].events = POLLIN;
This means you're interested in detecting when there's data available to read from the socket (a read event). Here are some of the most common events values:

POLLIN: Data is available to read (input is ready).

POLLOUT: The file descriptor is ready to write data.

POLLERR: There is an error condition.

POLLHUP: The file descriptor has been hung up (the other side of the connection has closed).

POLLNVAL: The file descriptor is invalid.

revents:
This field is set by poll() when an event on the corresponding file descriptor occurs. After poll() returns, you can check the revents field to see which events occurred for each file descriptor.

In your code, after calling poll(), you check fds[i].revents to handle events that were triggered:

c
Copy
Edit
if (fds[i].revents & POLLIN)
This checks if the POLLIN event (data available to read) has occurred for the file descriptor fds[i]. Here, you‚Äôre interested in reading data if the POLLIN event is set in the revents field.

Workflow:
You specify the events you're interested in by setting the events field.

You call poll(), which monitors the file descriptors.

When poll() returns, the revents field is updated to reflect the events that occurred on the file descriptors.

You check revents to see which events happened and take appropriate action.

In summary:

events is what you're watching for (what events you care about).

revents is what actually happened (which events occurred when poll() returns).

This mechanism allows you to efficiently handle multiple file descriptors without having to block on each one individually or use multiple threads.

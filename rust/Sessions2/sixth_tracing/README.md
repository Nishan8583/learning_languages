# tracing
In Rust, tracing and tracing-subscriber are both part of the Tokio tracing ecosystem, but they serve different purposes:
🔍 tracing – The instrumentation framework

    What it does: Provides the macros and core APIs to produce structured, event-based diagnostics (like tracing::info!, tracing::span!, tracing::error!, etc.).

    Think of it as: The producer of logs, spans, and events.

    You use it to:

        Instrument your application code.

        Create spans (for tracking execution over time).

        Emit events (for things like log messages).

    Example:

    use tracing::{info, span, Level};

    fn main() {
        let span = span!(Level::INFO, "my_span");
        let _enter = span.enter();
        info!("hello from inside the span");
    }

📦 tracing-subscriber – The consumer/handler

    What it does: Provides subscribers, formatting, filters, and layering functionality to consume and output the trace data generated by tracing.

    Think of it as: The consumer that decides how to display or store trace data.

    You use it to:

        Set up where logs go (e.g., to stdout, to a file, in JSON).

        Apply filtering (e.g., based on log level or target).

        Configure layers for metrics, filtering, formatting, etc.

    Example:

    use tracing_subscriber;

    fn main() {
        tracing_subscriber::fmt::init(); // Initializes a default subscriber

        tracing::info!("hello from tracing!");
    }

Summary Table
Feature	tracing	tracing-subscriber
Purpose	Producing spans and events	Consuming and formatting trace data
Provides macros	✅ info!, warn!, span!, etc.	❌
Registers as global	❌	✅ (via tracing::subscriber::set_global_default)
Formatting and filtering	❌	✅ (fmt, filter, layer, etc.)
Used by application logic	✅	✅ (during initialization)
🧠 In short:

    Use tracing to emit logs and spans.

    Use tracing-subscriber to configure how those logs and spans are handled (e.g., printed, filtered, exported).

Let me know if you want an example with JSON logs or filtering

# anyhow error
Yes, you're exactly right — anyhow::Result<()> is essentially:

Result<(), anyhow::Error>

And the anyhow::Error type does internally use Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync> (plus some extra features for better error messages and context). Here's a breakdown of how it works:
🔍 What is anyhow::Error?

The anyhow::Error type is a smart wrapper around any error type that implements std::error::Error + Send + Sync + 'static.

Internally, it's roughly equivalent to:

pub struct Error {
    inner: Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>
}

This allows anyhow::Error to store any concrete error type, just like how Box<dyn Error> works.
📦 How does anyhow::Result<()> work?

    The Result type in Rust is defined as:

enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}

So anyhow::Result<()> is just:

    Result<(), anyhow::Error>

    It means: the function returns () on success, or an anyhow::Error on failure — and that error can be any error type, thanks to trait objects.

🎯 Why use anyhow::Error instead of Box<dyn Error> directly?

    ✅ Better backtraces (via the backtrace crate)

    ✅ Context-aware errors: You can add context using .context("message")

    ✅ Pretty display: Better error formatting when printed

    ✅ Convenient ? support for most error types without needing From implementations

🧠 Behind the scenes:

If you do this:

use anyhow::Result;

fn do_something() -> Result<()> {
    let val: i32 = "not a number".parse()?;  // std::num::ParseIntError
    println!("Value: {}", val);
    Ok(())
}

Here’s what happens:

    "not a number".parse() returns a Result<i32, ParseIntError>.

    The ? operator converts the ParseIntError into anyhow::Error.

    This works because anyhow::Error implements From<E> for any E: Error + Send + Sync + 'static.

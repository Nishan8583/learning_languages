# QA with Chat GPT to understand Async:
### When I do .await on a future, the execution of current function halts, and the Future that awaited on gets put on a queue and executed. Is that correct ?
ChatGPT said:

You're close, but there’s a subtle yet important correction.
Let’s break it down:
✅ What actually happens when you .await a Future:

    The current function does not continue past the .await line — it yields control (pauses) at that point.

    The .await expression does not itself put anything on a queue. Instead, it checks whether the future is ready (i.e., it has produced a value).

    If the future is not ready, the current task (which is running on an executor) is suspended, and will be polled again later when the future becomes ready.

    The executor (e.g., Tokio or async-std) is the one responsible for polling tasks and putting them in a queue when needed.

🔄 So what’s the correct model?

    You have an async function that returns a Future.

    When you .await another future inside it:

        If the awaited future is ready, it proceeds immediately.

        If not, the current task is paused, and control is returned to the executor.

    The executor then schedules the current task to be resumed (i.e., polled again) when the awaited future signals that it's ready (via a Waker).

⚠️ Misconception in what Ardan Labs might’ve said:

    “the Future that awaited on gets put on a queue and executed”
    This makes it sound like the awaited future is now actively doing something. But Futures are lazy — they do nothing unless polled. The executor drives progress by polling them.

So it's not that the awaited future is put on a queue and run; rather:

    The current future is suspended.

    The executor decides what gets polled next.

TL;DR

    .await pauses the current function, it doesn’t enqueue the awaited future.

    The executor manages polling and queuing.

    Futures are polled, not “run” in the OS-thread sense.

    .await just turns the async function into a state machine that yields until the future is ready.

Let me know if you'd like a visual diagram or example of how this works under the hood.



### How would you know if a future is ready or not ?
ChatGPT said:

Great question — this goes to the heart of how async/await works in Rust under the hood.
🔧 How do you know if a Future is ready or not?

You don't check manually when using .await, but under the hood, the executor calls the poll() method on the Future to check if it's ready.
🚨 Key Concept: The poll() Method

Every type that implements the Future trait must define the method:

fn poll(self: Pin<&mut Self>, cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output>;

Where:

    cx: &mut Context gives access to a Waker, which the future uses to signal the executor when it’s ready to be polled again.

    Poll<Self::Output> is an enum:

        Poll::Pending – the future is not ready yet.

        Poll::Ready(val) – the future is ready, and you get the result.

✅ So how is readiness determined?

The poll() function is responsible for saying whether the future is ready or not.

Examples:

    A future wrapping a timer (e.g., tokio::time::sleep) returns Poll::Pending until the time elapses.

    A future waiting for a socket to be readable returns Poll::Pending until data arrives.

🧠 Putting it together

When you .await a future:

    The compiler turns your async fn into a state machine.

    The executor calls poll() on the future.

    Inside poll():

        If the result is Poll::Ready(val), execution proceeds.

        If Poll::Pending, the future registers the waker, so it can be woken up later when something changes (e.g., IO is ready, a timer expires, etc).

    The executor polls again later when woken.

🧪 Example: Custom Future

Here’s a basic example of a custom future that’s initially pending:

```rust
use std::future::Future;
use std::pin::Pin;
use std::task::{Context, Poll};

struct MyFuture {
    is_ready: bool,
}

impl Future for MyFuture {
    type Output = &'static str;

    fn poll(mut self: Pin<&mut Self>, _cx: &mut Context<'_>) -> Poll<Self::Output> {
        if self.is_ready {
            Poll::Ready("Done!")
        } else {
            self.is_ready = true;
            Poll::Pending
        }
    }
}
```
On the first poll, it returns Pending. On the second poll, it returns Ready.
Summary

    You don't check readiness manually — the executor does by calling poll().

    A future implements poll() and internally decides if it's ready or pending.

    If Pending, the future must arrange to be polled again later (usually via Waker).

Let me know if you'd like to see how .await compiles down to this state machine behavior.


### Lets say i have a simple async function, and another async function that does a HTTP request, when would these 2 Futures be assumed as ready ?
ChatGPT said:

Great — let’s explore this with your example of:

    A simple async function.

    An async function that performs an HTTP request.

You're asking: When would these two futures be considered “ready”?
🧩 1. Simple async function (no .await inside)

```rust
async fn simple_fn() -> i32 {
    42
}
```

When is this future "ready"?

    Immediately.

    Since there’s no .await, the compiler generates a Future that returns Poll::Ready(42) on the first poll().

    No async suspension points, so the future completes synchronously.

✅ Ready on first poll.
🧩 2. Async function that performs an HTTP request

```rust
async fn http_request() -> Result<String, reqwest::Error> {
    let res = reqwest::get("https://example.com").await?;
    res.text().await
}
```

When is this future "ready"?

This is more complex and will be initially Pending, and become Ready after the network IO completes.

Here’s how it unfolds:

    The function creates a future when called.

    The executor starts polling it.

    On the first .await (reqwest::get(...).await):

        The future for the HTTP GET is polled.

        If the network request hasn’t completed yet:

            It returns Poll::Pending.

            Registers a Waker with the underlying IO system.

    Once the socket receives the response:

        The runtime (e.g., Tokio) wakes up the task.

        The executor polls again.

    Same thing happens for res.text().await.

✅ Initially Pending, becomes Ready when network IO completes.
TL;DR Table
Function Type	Poll 1	Later Polls	Notes
async fn simple()	Ready	—	No .await, completes immediately
async fn http_request()	Pending	Ready (after IO)	.await suspends until socket has data

🧱 What is a union?

A union is a type that can hold one of several different types, but only one at a time.

In Zig:

```zig
const MyUnion = union {
    i: i32,
    f: f32,
};
```

This MyUnion can hold either:

    an i32 named i

    or an f32 named f

But not both at the same time.

However, plain unions are unsafe — Zig has no way of knowing what variant is currently active, and it’s up to you to track that manually. If you mess up, you get undefined behavior.
🏷️ What is a tagged union?

A tagged union is like a union with a built-in tag that tells you which variant is currently stored.

In Zig, that looks like this:
```zig
const MyTaggedUnion = union(enum) {
    i: i32,
    f: f32,
};
```
Now, MyTaggedUnion is safe. It stores:

    The actual value (i or f)

    A hidden tag (enum) that tells you which one is active

So you can safely switch on it:
```zig
fn useIt(x: MyTaggedUnion) void {
    switch (x) {
        .i => |val| std.debug.print("int: {}\n", .{val}),
        .f => |val| std.debug.print("float: {}\n", .{val}),
    }
}
```
No chance of reading the wrong field — Zig checks it for you.
📦 Analogy

Think of it like a box that can contain either a cat or a dog:

    A union is like a box that may have either, but you have to remember what you put in.

    A tagged union is a box with a label on the outside that says "cat" or "dog", so you always know what's inside before opening it.



```OK gotchya, why are we defining run inside the tagged union type Task, won't definig it outside work as well ?```

Nice — you're thinking like a systems programmer now 😎
✅ Short Answer:

Yes — you can absolutely define run outside the Task union. Putting it inside is just a style/design choice, not a requirement.
🧠 Why define run inside the tagged union?

It's kind of like attaching methods to a "class" in OOP — it keeps the behavior associated with the data. So:
```zig
const Task = union(enum) {
    say: Say,
    db_cleaner: void,

    pub fn run(task: Task) void {
        ...
    }
};
```

Here:

    You're grouping the run() function with the Task type itself.

    It's similar to putting methods inside a class in C++/Rust/Java/etc.

    It signals to the reader: "This function is conceptually a part of Task."

This is more self-contained and easier to reason about when your codebase grows.
🛠️ Defining run outside works too:

If you prefer a more C-style or plain top-level function approach, you can do this:

```
const Task = union(enum) {
    say: Say,
    db_cleaner: void,
};

pub fn run(task: Task) void {
    switch (task) {
        ...
    }
}
```

Totally fine. Functionally identical. It's up to you or your team's code style.
💡 Bonus: Inside-vs-Outside Analogy
Style	Feels Like
Function inside type	OOP-ish / self-contained
Function outside type	C-style / procedural

Zig doesn't enforce either. You just pick what fits your design best.

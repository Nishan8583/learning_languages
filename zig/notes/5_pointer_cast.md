What does "@ptrCast" and "@intToPtr" do ?

Great deep dive question — these are core Zig low-level features, and since you’re working with system-level stuff like Windows hooks, it’s important to understand them well.
🧠 @ptrCast — Pointer Cast
🔹 What it does:

@ptrCast reinterprets a pointer as another type — without changing the actual memory.

It's like saying:

    “I know this pointer points to something, but I want Zig to treat it as a pointer to this other type.”

✅ Example:

const raw: *u8 = ...; // some raw byte pointer
const as_int: *i32 = @ptrCast(*i32, raw); // treat it as pointer to i32

🧠 You’re not changing the data — just how Zig views the memory.
🧠 @intToPtr — Integer to Pointer
🔹 What it does:

@intToPtr converts an integer (usually an address) into a pointer.

Windows API sometimes gives you pointers as integers (like LPARAM), so you have to convert them back to actual usable pointers.
✅ Example:

const addr: usize = 0x12345678;
const ptr: *u8 = @intToPtr(*u8, addr);

🔄 Typical Use Case (like yours):

const raw_ptr = @intToPtr(*anyopaque, @as(usize, lParam));
const kb_ptr = @ptrCast(*const win.KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT, raw_ptr);

📝 What this does step-by-step:

    lParam is an integer — a pointer address given by Windows.

    @intToPtr makes it an opaque pointer (*anyopaque)

    @ptrCast tells Zig “this opaque pointer is actually a pointer to a KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT struct.”

🚨 Why both are needed?

Because Zig is type-safe and explicit:

    You can’t just cast integers directly to typed pointers.

    You can’t cast between incompatible pointer types without @ptrCast.

🧪 Analogy:

In C:

KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT *kb = (KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT *)lParam;

In Zig:

const kb = @ptrCast(*const win.KBDLLHOOKSTRUCT, @intToPtr(*anyopaque, @as(usize, lParam)));

More verbose — but much safer and clearer in the long run.

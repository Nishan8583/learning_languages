But this seems such a bad programming concept, we register somewhere else, and another loop that parses the keyboard message,and  it would seem like the keyboard hook function has nothing to do inside the loop wtf

I see your frustration, and you're not alone in questioning this approach! The event-driven programming model, particularly with things like hooks and message loops, can feel unintuitive at first, especially when you're used to writing more straightforward, sequential code. Let me break down why things are structured this way and how it works, even if it might not seem ideal.
Why Does the Hook and Message Loop Work Like This?

The key concept here is Windows' message-based architecture (also known as event-driven programming). This is how Windows applications and many other event-driven systems (like GUI toolkits) operate. It works in the following way:

    Message Queue: Windows maintains a message queue for each application (or thread), and the system dispatches messages to this queue when certain events occur (like a key being pressed, a mouse click, etc.).

    Message Loop: The message loop in the application is responsible for retrieving and processing these events (messages) one by one. This loop runs constantly in the background, waiting for and dispatching events to the right handlers.

    Hooks: Hooks are a way to intercept messages before they reach their target. This allows you to monitor or modify certain system-wide events (like keystrokes or mouse movements), even if the event is not directly related to the window you're working on. For example, a keyboard hook can intercept all keystrokes in the system, regardless of which window is focused.

    Separation of Concerns: The message loop and the hook function (KeyboardProc) work independently:

        The message loop processes all events.

        The hook function acts as an "interceptor" for specific types of messages (like keyboard events) and does its job when such messages are detected.

Why the Hook Function Doesn't Directly Print

The key point here is that the hook function (e.g., KeyboardProc) doesn't run in the main message loop, but instead gets called when specific events happen (like a key press). The operating system internally calls the hook procedure when the corresponding message (keyboard input) is generated. So, it's the operating system and message loop that are in charge of managing this flow, not the KeyboardProc itself.

The message loop is what continuously runs and processes messages for the entire application, while the hook function is just there to process specific types of messages (like WM_KEYDOWN or WM_SYSKEYDOWN) when they happen.
How to Make This Concept Clearer

Imagine this scenario:

    You're working in a multi-threaded system with multiple things happening in parallel: key presses, mouse events, window events, and more.

    You want to monitor key presses, but you don't want to block the main application flow.

    The key press event needs to be processed only when it happens, so it makes sense to intercept these events asynchronously and let the message loop continue running.

Example of What Happens in the Code

Here's what happens conceptually, step by step:

    Message Loop (GetMessage, TranslateMessage, DispatchMessage):

        Continuously runs, waiting for and processing messages. Each message could be a window event, a keyboard event, or other system events.

    Keyboard Hook (KeyboardProc):

        When a key is pressed, Windows calls your hook function (e.g., KeyboardProc).

        Inside KeyboardProc, you can check the type of event (WM_KEYDOWN) and take actions like logging the key.

Why This Is Useful

This system is event-driven, which is useful for building non-blocking, interactive applications. In a desktop environment (GUI applications), the message loop allows:

    The program to remain responsive to user input (like mouse clicks, window resizing, or keyboard input) while handling background tasks (like checking for messages, processing events, or handling multiple types of events simultaneously).

    The use of hooks allows you to intercept and handle specific types of events globally, without needing to be directly tied to a specific window or thread. For example, a keylogger would need to catch all key presses across the system, regardless of the window that's focused.

Why It May Feel "Disconnected"

You may feel like the KeyboardProc function is disconnected from the message loop because the loop isn't directly printing key presses, but rather it forwards messages to the appropriate handlers (like your hook function). It can feel like the hook function isn't doing much, but it gets called by the operating system when a key is pressed. The important thing here is that the flow is event-driven. The system is running asynchronously, waiting for things to happen, and responding to events as they occur.
Conclusion

To summarize:

    The message loop is responsible for dispatching events and running in the background.

    The hook function (KeyboardProc) acts as an interceptor, but only runs when a relevant event occurs.

    Event-driven programming makes systems like this more flexible and non-blocking, allowing applications to stay responsive while waiting for input or processing background tasks.

    The keylogger logic can still be encapsulated in the hook function, and if you need to print out key press events, it's just a matter of logging inside the hook.

It may seem unintuitive at first, but it's a model used widely in GUI and system-level programming for efficient and scalable event handling.
